# Tank Royale
#### Please note, Tank Royal is in Pre-Alpha stages of development. The current game does not reflect the end result. Currently development is getting a working game with simple controls and simple mechanics. In the future, the game will consist of; More advanced controls, such as the player will have to individually control each track of the tank. More advanced mechanics, such as aiming mechanics and shooting mechanics, Projectiles will be effected by gravity pull and maybe even wind!
Simply a low poly tank battle royale! Open-world, head-to-head tank battle with advanced controls using Unreal Engine 4.
